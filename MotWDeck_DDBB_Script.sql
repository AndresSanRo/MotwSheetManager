(8, "The Mundane", "You heard about how monsters only pick on people with crazy powers who can fight back on even terms? Yeah, me neither. But, hell, i ended up in this monster-hunting team so I gotta do what I can, right?"),
(9, "The Professional", "It´s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 job is to hunt down monsters. Still, that´s the job I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say \"You don´t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!\""),

(11, "The Spooky", "I can do things, things thet normal people can´t. But there´s a price--I haven´t paid it full, yet, but the bill´s gonna come due soon. It´s best I don´t tell you any more. You get too close, you´ll get hurt."),
(12, "The Wronged", "They took my loved ones. Back then I wasn´t strong enought to fight, but I studied, trained, and now I´m ready to cleanse the world of their taint. I´ll kill them all, That´s all i have left.");
